# About

Welcome to the Hextraction Catalog!

## What's all this about?

### The Game

Hextraction is a free, open source board game designed for 3D printing by [Zach Freedman](https://www.youtube.com/@ZackFreedman).
You can read more about it on the [official site](https://www.playhextraction.com/what-in-tarnation).
Please note that this site is purely a community effort and not directly affiliated with Zach or Voidstar Lab.
If you have questions, for example how to get started printing the game, the community discord is the perfect place.

### The Site

This site assumes you have a basic understanding of the game.
The goal is to make it easy to browse new ways to play and search the countless community tiles to play with!
