# 1-Up

2

# prevent the user from adding a new scale or removing

# a scale is a discount, an item can have 1-10 scales
one case is one scale, a 3 case is one scale

holy shit this sounds so fucking good i cant believe this

if they have an item in the promo at all for a published promo,
they cannot add that item in there at all

the only exception is for a future dated deal, they delete the item,
and they add the item

future promo it should be allowed for them to delete and add new
for an active promo they cannot expire and add new
