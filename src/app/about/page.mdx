# About Nextra

Nextra was initially created by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) members
[Shu Ding](https://twitter.com/shuding_) and
[Paco Coursey](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey) in 2020. Since 2021,
[Yixuan Xu](https://twitter.com/yixuanxu94) contributed tremendously to the
project.

In 2022, [Dimitri Postolov](https://twitter.com/dimaMachina_) from
[The Guild](https://the-guild.dev) joined the core team to help with the
development of Nextra 2.

In 2024 Nextra 3 was released, current primary maintainer Dimitri Postolov fully
developed it, and [Oscar Xie](https://github.com/87xie)
[actively contributed](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+author%3A87xie+is%3Aclosed+created%3A%3C2024-10-03)
to this release.

In 2025 Nextra 4 with [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) support was
released, Dimitri Postolov fully developed it too.

Welcome to the Hextraction Catalog! This site is under active development by [cadeluca](https://github.com/cadeluca).

## What's all this about?

### The Game

Hextraction is a free, open source board game designed for 3D printing by [Zack Freedman](https://www.youtube.com/@ZackFreedman).
You can read more about it on the [official site](https://www.playhextraction.com/what-in-tarnation).
Please note that this site is purely a community effort and not directly affiliated with Zack or Voidstar Lab.
If you have questions about the game, for example how to get started printing the game, the Voidstar Lab [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/voidstarlab) is the ideal place. The Discord server is also linked in the site's navigation bar.

### The Site

This site assumes you have a basic understanding of the game.
The goal is to make it easy to browse new ways to play and search the countless community tiles to play with! Individual tile pages are generated from data - these pages are in the very early stages. You can explore the full list via the Tile Table.

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
  The Tile Table [experimental] is [live](/tile_table) - give it a try and share
  your feedback!
</Callout>

This site is developed using Nextra, a documentation framework built with Next.js.
Check out the GitHub page to see the source, ask questions pertaining to the site,
report bugs, and more.

### The Data

The data is sourced from the [Community Catalog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JfqIVOjToIS0rCQC8AIWeRLpMmSNDphn8_660eaTjaY/edit?gid=414788452#gid=414788452&fvid=104313283).
It is highly encouraged if you are a tile maker that you add your tiles to the sheet.
Please be respectful of the formatting set by the sheet maintainers!

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ•‘">
  To be enabled soon: auto updates via cronjob (in github actions) once the tile
  page design has more detail.
</Callout>
